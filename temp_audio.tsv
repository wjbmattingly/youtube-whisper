0	2460	Hi, and welcome back to this channel.
2460	3800	In this video, we're going to be looking at
3800	8000	the new chat GPT feature that allows for you to create custom GPTs.
8000	10320	When you load up chat.openai.com,
10320	12520	your new window looks something like this.
12520	15160	On the left-hand side, you'll see this Explore button.
15160	20520	If we click Explore, we'll be taken to a new prompt where we can go ahead and start creating a new GPT.
20520	23920	In this video, we're going to try to create a new GPT that can classify
23920	27600	specific kinds of entities, namely vehicles and buildings.
27600	32360	To do this, we're going to hit Create a GPT and we'll be taken to this prompt here.
32360	37840	This page allows for us to pass natural language instructions to create a set of
37840	41120	custom rules for this GPT model to follow.
41120	42920	What's really cool about this is that
42920	48080	a OpenAI will take care of creating everything for us automatically with natural language.
48080	51120	So what do we want this GPT to really do?
51120	53160	Well, what we wanted to do is we wanted to be able to take in
53160	57200	an input text and automatically annotate it by giving us things like
57280	60720	different kinds of buildings, people, places, etc.
60720	64760	In other words, we wanted to function kind of like a named entity recognizer
64760	67120	that can work without a scope data.
67120	70400	Let's go ahead and give it these very natural instructions.
70400	76920	Create a GPT that can identify named entities.
76920	87160	I want to find things like vehicles, places, people, events, dates, and buildings.
87360	94000	Output the data as JSON only.
94000	98080	And this will let us have a JSON schema that we can use going forward.
98080	99800	So let's go ahead and just hit Enter.
99800	104480	And we'll notice that immediately OpenAI's GPT builder starts spinning up.
104480	108080	Now, what's happening here in the back end is OpenAI is taking our natural
108080	113880	instructions and translating them into proper configuration rules, essentially,
113880	117080	which was he populated in the Configure section in just a moment.
117080	123040	And as you can see, this entire process only takes roughly about 20 seconds to do.
123040	126680	Once this is done, it's going to prompt us to give it a new name.
126680	129440	And we can go ahead and just accept what it gives us.
129440	130720	Yes, I like that.
130720	134680	So go ahead and name it essentially entity explorer.
134680	136960	And we'll see that it's happy with our choice.
136960	140840	And then it's finally going to prompt for us to generate essentially an image for this.
140840	142880	This will be its profile image.
142920	145600	And it's using Dolly 3 to do this in just a moment.
145600	147320	This is going to be done.
147320	150480	While this is happening, let's go ahead and explore what's happening on the right
150480	151720	hand of the screen.
151720	155440	On the right side of the screen, we see things like find entities in this text and
155440	156960	all these other little prompts.
156960	160920	This is the result of the config file that's already been generated for us.
160920	164080	And this is where we can test out how this model is working and
164080	166160	if it's doing what we want it to do.
166160	168960	And we're going to go ahead and say, yes, keep that.
168960	170280	And we're happy with it.
170280	173600	So now that we have our image, our title, and our set of instructions,
173600	176040	let's go ahead and take a look at the configure section.
177440	181600	As you can tell, we've gone ahead and already got this all populated for us.
181600	184880	This is what GPT builder was doing in the background.
184880	186840	As you can tell, we've got a couple different things here,
186840	190120	such as the name of it, which hasn't been updated yet, a description of it,
190120	193480	which we can see populated here, and a brief set of instructions,
193480	197760	which it's translated for us into probably a better collection of instructions.
197760	202440	And it's also given us a couple conversation starters, which pop up right here.
202440	206120	Let's go ahead and go back to create and take a look at what we can do.
206120	209200	So let's go ahead and say, find entities in this text.
209200	213240	But I'm just going to go ahead and paste in an opening bit of dialogue from
213240	215760	a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum testimony.
217200	219960	And as you can tell, all I've had to do in this is in real time is simply
219960	222960	paste in a single block of text.
222960	225800	Now what I like to do when I'm creating one of these builders is I like to give
225800	228760	it as few instructions as possible, especially if I'm doing something like
228760	231680	classification, which named entity recognition is.
231680	234680	And the reason for this is because it will come up with a schema.
234680	239000	And I can look at the schema and say, hmm, do I like this or do I not like this?
239000	242160	And what I can do for my next iteration of this creation,
242160	247000	when I start to adjust these instructions, is I can use the schema that it's generated
247000	250480	and go ahead and accept that and apply it into the main text.
250480	252560	So as you can see, we're getting a couple outputs and
252560	255160	we have different kinds of entities being populated.
255160	260360	We have a person in this case, Agnes Adaki, and it keeps on going on down the list.
260360	264320	And it even has extracted this individual's maiden name as well.
264320	267120	If we keep on going down, we see other kinds of events.
267120	269440	In this case, this is a place.
269440	273280	And it's also specifically referencing Budapest Hungry and
273280	275800	the date of the event actually taking place.
275800	279000	So in this case, this isn't functioning like a typical NER model.
279000	281400	Rather, it's giving a lot of extra metadata.
281400	283920	What's really nice about this is for as far as I can tell,
283920	285880	I'm not seeing any hallucinations.
285880	289200	Now that's not to indicate that hallucinations won't actually occur.
289200	291640	In fact, you can probably expect that they do.
291640	294760	What I like to do though is just use this as a way to kind of explore my data
294760	297440	real quickly and do some manual validation.
297440	301800	This helps me think through ways in which I can kind of structure structured metadata.
301800	305160	But let's just pretend for just a moment that I'd like all of this.
305160	306680	What can I do at this stage?
306680	309960	Well, let's say I want to just work with this internally.
309960	312560	I can click the Save button and I can select,
312560	315600	I only want to be the one to view this and work with it.
315600	318960	I'll do this when I'm developing this, at least testing out a couple things.
318960	321920	When I'm ready to send this out and have other individuals test this model and
321920	326280	how it's performing on out of scope data that probably I can't come up with,
326280	331200	I can then allow only people with the link to actually access and use this model.
331200	335320	And then finally, once I pass that test, I can go ahead and select public and
335320	339320	make this publicly available for others to test it and give larger feedback.
339320	343680	But overall, that's a very quick introduction to this new OpenAI feature
